d8		Memory		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1		You recall a physically painful moment. What mark or scar on your body does it relate to?		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2		A memory causes you to shed a tear. Is it a bitter or cheerful memory? Does recalling it make you feel the same way?		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3		You recall a childhood memory. What about that event or who you were still influences you?		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4		A memory brings with it the voice of someone once close to you. How do they advise you?		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5		You recall enjoying something that you can’t stand doing now. What is it? Why don’t you like it now?		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6		A memory carries a vivid smell or sensation. What are you going to do to recreate that experience?		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7		You faintly remember a place that couldn’t possibly exist. What is this vision? How does it make you feel?		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8		You experience a memory you’re certain isn’t your own. How does it seem unnatural? Could it be a glimpse of a past nightmare or something worse?
