The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths \u2014 all of these things call to your heart. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi\u2019s hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.",
