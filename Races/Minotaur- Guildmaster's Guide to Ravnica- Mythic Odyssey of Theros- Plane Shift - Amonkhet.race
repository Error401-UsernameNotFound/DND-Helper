    "Name": "Minotaur- Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica- Mythic Odyssey of Theros- Plane Shift - Amonkhet",
    "Description": "Minotaurs are powerfully built, barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling rams. Their horns curl tightly against the sides of their heads to encircle their ears, and manes of shaggy fur \u2014 shorter in females \u2014 fall over their broad shoulders. As their appearance suggests, they combine physical strength with stubbornness, bravado, and reckless bravery. They revel in combat, especially when the odds against them seem overwhelming.Minotaurs are rowdy, boisterous, and direct to the point of rudeness. They have no qualms about declaring what they want and defying others to keep it from them. In combat, they bellow loud challenges in defiance of their foes, and roar with laughter as they triumph.Minotaurs believe they hold a unique place among the races of Amonkhet. The khenra can look to Hazoret, the naga to Rhonas, and the aven to Kefnet to see themselves represented among the gods. Humans have no single god to look to, which explains why they demonstrate such variety. But only one god bears a pair of curving horns: the God-Pharaoh himself, who holds a special place for many of the minotaurs of Amonkhet.",
    "ASI": "Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\n",
    "Features": "Age. Minotaurs develop more slowly than humans, reaching full maturity around the age of 20. They typically become acolytes at around 8 or 9 years old, making them among the older members of their crops. Once they reach maturity, though, minotaurs age quickly, rushing headlong through the trials (as they do all aspects of life) to complete them before they pass their peak. A minotaur allowed to die of old age would rarely live beyond 40.\n\nAlignment. Most minotaurs lean toward chaotic alignments, and they have a slight inclination toward evil.\n\nSize. Minotaurs average over 6 feet in height, and they have strong, stocky builds. Your size is Medium.\n\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\nNatural Weapon. You can use your horns as a natural weapon to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with your horns, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.\n\nMenacing.

You can speak, read, and write Common and Minotaur.\n"
