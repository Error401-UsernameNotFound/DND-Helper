    "Name": "Shifter",
    "Description": "Shifters are sometimes called weretouched, as they are descendants of people who contracted full or partial lycanthropy. Humanoids with a bestial aspect, shifters can\u2019t fully change shape, but they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features by entering a state they call shifting.Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies. While a shifter\u2019s appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.Most shifters resemble a particular kind of lycanthrope. You can choose the kind of lycanthrope in your past, or you can determine it randomly by rolling on the Lycanthrope Ancestor table. The table also provides a suggestion for the Shifting option you might have as a result of your ancestry.\n\n\t\tLycanthrope Ancestor\t\t\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nd6\t\tAncestor\t\tSuggested Shifting Option\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1\t\tWerebear\t\tBeasthide\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2\t\tWereboar\t\tBeasthide\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3\t\tWererat\t\tSwiftstride\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4\t\tWeretiger\t\tSwiftstride\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5\t\tWerewolf (wolflike)\t\tLongtooth\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6\t\tWerewolf (doglike)\t\tWildhunt\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n",
