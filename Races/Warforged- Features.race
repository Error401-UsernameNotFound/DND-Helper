    "Features": "Age. A typical warforged is between two and thirty years old. The maximum lifespan of the warforged remains a mystery; so far, warforged have shown no signs of deterioration due to age.\n\nAlignment. Most warforged take comfort in order and discipline, tending toward law and neutrality. But some have absorbed the morality \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 of the beings with which they served.\n\nSize. Your size is Medium. Most warforged stand between 5 and 6&#160;1/2 feet tall. Weight and build are affected by subrace.\n\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\nWarforged Resilience. You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits.\n\nYou have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.\nYou are immune to disease.\nYou don\u2019t need to eat, drink, or breathe.\nYou don't need to sleep and don't suffer the effects of exhaustion due to lack of rest, and magic can\u2019t put you to sleep.\n\nSentry's Rest. When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn\u2019t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.\n\nIntegrated Protection. Your body has built-in defensive layers, which determine your armor class. You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you apply its bonus as normal.\n\nYou can alter your body to enter different defensive modes; each time you finish a long rest, choose one mode to adopt from the Integrated Protection table, provided you meet the mode\u2019s prerequisite.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrated Protection\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMode\t\tPrerequisite\t\tEffect\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDarkwood Core (unarmored)\t\tNone\t\tAC = 11 + your Dexterity modifier (add proficiency bonus if proficient with light armor).\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nComposite Plating (armored)\t\tMedium armor proficiency\t\tAC = 13 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of 2) + your proficiency bonus.\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHeavy Plating (armored)\t\tHeavy armor proficiency\t\tAC = 16 + your proficiency bonus; disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLanguages.
