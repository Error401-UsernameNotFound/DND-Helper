    "Name": "Goblin",
    "Description": "A subterranean folk, goblins can be found in every corner of the multiverse, often beside their bugbear and hobgoblin kin. Long before the god Maglubiyet conquered them, early goblins served in the court of the Queen of Air and Darkness, one of the Feywild\u2019s archfey. Goblins thrived in her dangerous domain thanks to a special boon from her\u2014a supernatural knack for finding the weak spots in foes larger than themselves and for getting out of trouble. Goblins brought this fey boon with them to worlds across the Material Plane, even if they don\u2019t remember the fey realm they inhabited before Maglubiyet\u2019s rise. Now many goblins pursue their own destinies, escaping the plots of both archfey and gods.",
