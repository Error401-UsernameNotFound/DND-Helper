    "ASI": "Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and one other Ability Score of your choice increases by 1.",
    "Features": "\nDeductive Intuition. Whenever you make a Intelligence (Investigation) or a Wisdom (Insight) check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the total ability check.\n\nMagical Detection. You can cast the Detect Magic and the Detect Poison and Disease spells with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast the See Invisibility spell with it. Once you cast either spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell again until you finish a Long Rest. Intelligence is your Spellcasting Ability for these spells, and you don't require material components for them.\n\nSpells of the Mark. If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Detection Spells table are added to the spell list of your Spellcasting class.\nMark of Detection Spell\n\nSpell Level\t\tSpell\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1st\t\tDetect Magic\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2nd\t\tDetect Thoughts\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3rd\t\tClairvoyance\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4th\t\tArcane Eye\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5th\t\tLegend Lore\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"
