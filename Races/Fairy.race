    "Description": "The Feywild is home to many fantastic peoples, including fairies. Fairies are a wee folk, but not nearly as much so as their pixie and sprite friends. The first fairies spoke Elvish, Goblin, or Sylvan, and encounters with human visitors prompted many of them to learn Common as well.Infused with the magic of the Feywild, most fairies look like Small elves with insectile wings, but each fairy has a special physical characteristic that sets the fairy apart. For your fairy, roll on the Fey Characteristics table or choose an option from it. You\u2019re also free to come up with your own characteristic if none of the suggestions below fit your character.\n\n\t\tFey Characteristics\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nd8\t\tCharacteristic\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1\t\tYour wings are like those of a bird.\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2\t\tYou have shimmering, multicolored skin.\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3\t\tYou have exceptionally large ears.\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4\t\tA glittering mist constantly surrounds you.\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5\t\tYou have a small spectral horn on your forehead, like a little unicorn horn.\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6\t\tYour legs are insectile.\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n7\t\tYou smell like fresh brownies.\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n8\t\tA noticeable, harmless chill surrounds you.\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n",
