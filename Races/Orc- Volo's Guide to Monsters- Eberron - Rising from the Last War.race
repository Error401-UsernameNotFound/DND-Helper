    "Name": "Orc- Volo's Guide to Monsters- Eberron - Rising from the Last War",
    "Description": "Thousands of years before humans came to Khorvaire, the land was dominated by wild ores and goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire. The goblin empire scattered the ore tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the ores learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.",
