    "Description": "Orcs originally came from the same mountainous region where the kingdom of Torrezon was born, and they have been enemies of the Legion of Dusk since it was originally formed. The entire race has been declared anathema by the Church of Torrezon, and after centuries of fighting the Legion, the orcs have dwindled to only a few hundred in number. Some still live on remote islands near Torrezon, but many have joined the Brazen Coalition to serve on pirate ships \u2014 taking on any role that calls for an abundance of sheer muscle.Orcs are tall, standing head and shoulders above most humans, and are generally twice as broad. They often accentuate their bulging muscles by wearing tight-fitting bands and accessories around the thickest parts of their arms and necks. Their skin color ranges from light brown through gray to almost jet-black.",
