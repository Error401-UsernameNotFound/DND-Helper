Due to their curiosity, many kender have found themselves falling through gates and portals to other planes and worlds.\nUnknown to most mortals, a magical phenomenon surrounds a kender. Spurred by their curiosity and love for trinkets, curios, and keepsakes, a kender\u2019s pouches or pockets will be magically filled with these objects.
