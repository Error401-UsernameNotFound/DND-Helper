    "Name": "Merfolk- Plane Shift - Zendikar",
    "Description": "ous, thoughtful, and analytical, the merfolk of Zendikar are natural scholars and explorers. In the past, merfolk society was organized around their belief in three deities. But in the wake of the reappearance of the Eldrazi, the merfolk have realized that their faith was a web of lies, built on a corrupted memory of the Eldrazi titans handed down from generation to generation. In peaceful times, the merfolk might have fought over the ultimate meaning of this revelation. But faced with the danger presented by the Eldrazi broods, the merfolk have largely set aside their differences and joined together in a united force. Old grudges still linger, but the well-being of the merfolk race\u2014and the world\u2014far outweigh any ancient conflicts between creeds.olk are associated with knowledge, logic, and strategy, though the traditional merfolk creeds express this connection in different ways.",

Merfolk of the wind and water creeds aren\u2019t hostile to each other, but members of each creed regard the other creed with a vague disdain. Members of both those creeds regard the Cosi creed with suspicion and some degree of fear, and Cosi-creed adherents tend to keep their affiliation secret. Choose one of these creeds for your character.\n\nEmeria (Wind) Creed\n\nMerfolk who followed Emeria\u2019s creed seek wisdom and truth in the Wind Realm, exploring the mystical forces\u2014rather than natural causes\u2014behind historical events.
