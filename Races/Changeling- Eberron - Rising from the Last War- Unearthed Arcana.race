    "Name": "Changeling- Eberron - Rising from the Last War- Unearthed Arcana",
    "Description": "ce: Unearthed Arcana 52 - Eberron Races",
    "ASI": "Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 2, and either your Dexterity or your Intelligence increases by 1 (your choice).\n",
    "Features": "Age. Changelings mature slightly faster than humans but share a similar lifespan \u2014 typically a century or less. While a changeling can transform to conceal their age, the effects of aging affect them similarly to humans.\n\nAlignment. Changelings hate to be bound in any way, and those who follow the path of the Traveler believe that chaos and change are important aspects of life. Most tend toward pragmatic neutrality as opposed to being concerned with lofty ideals. Few changelings embrace evil.\n\nSize. In their natural forms, changelings average between 5 and 6 feet in height, with a slender build. Your size is Medium.\n\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\nChange Appearance. As an action, you can transform your appearance or revert to your natural form. You can\u2019t duplicate the appearance of a creature you\u2019ve never seen, and you revert to your natural form if you die.\n\nYou decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, coloration, hair length, sex, and any other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You also can\u2019t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you\u2019re bipedal, you can\u2019t use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance. Your clothing and other equipment don\u2019t change in appearance, size, or shape to match your new form, requiring you to keep a few extra outfits on hand to make the most compelling disguise possible.\nEven to the most astute observers, your ruse is usually indiscernible. If you rouse suspicion, or if a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.\n\nUnsettling Visage. When a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll. You must use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Using this trait reveals your shapeshifting nature to any creature within 30 feet that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\nDivergent Persona. You gain proficiency with one tool of your choice. Define a unique identity associated with that proficiency; establish the name, race, gender, age, and other details. While you are in the form of this persona, the related proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that proficiency.\n\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice.\n"
