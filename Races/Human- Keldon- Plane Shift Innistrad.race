    "Name": "Human- Keldon- Plane Shift Innistrad",
    "Description": "Innistrad\u2019s population is mostly human, and player characters in an Innistrad campaign should be human in most circumstances. However, the humans of Kessig are different in many respects from those of Gavony, and Nephalia\u2019s urban culture is very distinct from the shadow-draped land of Stensia. Diversity among player characters comes not from race, but from each character\u2019s home province.Human characters on Innistrad have the following traits. If you use these human traits, do not use the variant human traits presented in the //Player\u2019s Handbook. As well, in campaigns that use feats, characters should not be allowed to choose feats that duplicate any provincial traits./",
