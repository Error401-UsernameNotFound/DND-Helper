    "Name": "Orc",
    "Description": "Orcs trace their creation to the one-eyed god Gruumsh, an unstoppable warrior and powerful leader. The divine qualities of Gruumsh resonate within orcs, granting them a reflection of his toughness and tenacity that can\u2019t be matched, and the god equipped his children to be able to live above or below ground.On some worlds, such as Eberron, orcs were among the first defenders of the natural order from the encroachments of Fiends and other extraplanar threats. Gruumsh\u2019s blessings have made orcs tireless guardians and mighty allies wherever they are found, even when they turn their devotion to other gods.",
