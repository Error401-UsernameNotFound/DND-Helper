Storm's Boon. You have resistance to Lightning damage.

Headwinds. You know the Gust cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast the Gust of Wind spell with it. Once you cast this spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell again until you finish a Long Rest. Charisma is your Spellcasting Ability for this spell.
