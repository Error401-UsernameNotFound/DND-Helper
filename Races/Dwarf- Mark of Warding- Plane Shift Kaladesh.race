    "Name": "Dwarf- Mark of Warding- Plane Shift Kaladesh",
    "Description": "Dwarves don\u2019t understand laziness or shortcuts. Just as a machine must function smoothly at all times, so too an artisan should work steadily and with care. Dwarves take pride in their work ethic, and abhor any attitude or behavior that would undermine the quality of their work. They are more thorough than speedy, and although a dwarf\u2019s work might take longer to complete, its quality makes the time worthwhile. If a job must be done, a dwarf will see that it is done correctly. And when a dwarf repairs a machine, it will work as well as it did when it was first built, if not better \u2014 and it will last.",
    "ASI": "Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\n",
    "Features": "Age. Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.\n\nAlignment. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.\n\nSize. Dwarves stand around 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.\n\nDarkvision. Accustomed to life underground in your race\u2019s ancient past, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can\u2019t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\nDwarven Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.\n\nDwarven Toughness. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.\n\nArtisan's Expertise. You gain proficiency with two kinds of artisan\u2019s tools of your choice. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. In addition, whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of any architectural construction (including buildings, public works such as canals and aqueducts, and the massive cogwork that underlies much of the construction of Ghirapur), you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.\n\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might\nSee also: Duergar (MPMM)"
