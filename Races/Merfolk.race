Description:
Merfolk are an amphibious race, born and at home in the water but comfortable on dry land. Humanoid in form, they have skin of ivory, silver, russet, blue, or deep purple. Long fins extend from the backs of their forearms and calves, and their fingers and toes are webbed. The hairlike growths on their heads are either thick and bristly like the needles of a sea urchin, or long and wavy, resembling fine seaweed. In either case, these growths typically range in color from red to warm brown to black. Male merfolk have similar growths extending down from their cheekbonesRiver Heralds are merfolkâ€”a race of amphibious humanoids at home throughout the oceans, rivers, and rain forests of Ixalan. They stand between seven and eight feet tall, with skin that ranges from deep burgundy through many shades of violet and blue, to green, bright orange, and yellow. They are humanlike in shape, but have long fins extending from their shoulders, forearms, middle backs, and calves. Frills of fins also protrude from the backs of their heads. All merfolk can breathe air or filter oxygen from the water, and they can walk on land or swim with equal ease.

Green Merfolk

Green merfolk generally have yellow chests and pale green faces, shading to dark blues and purples on their backs and limbs. The patterns on their skin suggest the colors of the tree frogs common in the rain forest, as do their eyes of orange, lime green, or sky blue. Their fins are relatively short and thick. They climb trees with ease, move through undergrowth unhindered, and often wield magic to shape vines and branches to their will.
