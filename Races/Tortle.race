    "Name": "Tortle",
    "Description": "Tortles have a saying: \u201cWe wear our homes on our backs.\u201d These turtle folk live on many worlds, most often journeying up and down coasts, along waterways, and across the sea. Tortles don\u2019t have a unified story of how they were created, but they all have a sense of being mystically connected to the natural world. Carrying their shelter on their backs gives tortles a special feeling of security wherever they go, for even if they visit a far, unknown country, they have a place to lay their heads.Tortles exhibit the same range of coloration and patterns found among turtles, and many tortles enjoy adorning their shells in distinctive ways.",
    "ASI": "Ability Score Increase. When determining your character\u2019s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.\n",
    "Features": "Creature Type. You are a Humanoid.\n\nSize. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.\n\nSpeed. Your walking speed is 30 feet.\n\nClaws. You have claws that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\n\nHold Breath. You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour.\n\nNatural Armor. Your shell provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn\u2019t affect this number). You can\u2019t wear light, medium, or heavy armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield\u2019s bonus as normal.\n\nNature's Intuition. Thanks to your mystical connection to nature, you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Stealth, or Survival.\n\nShell Defense. You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can\u2019t increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can\u2019t take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.\n\nLanguages. Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player\u2019s Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.\n"
