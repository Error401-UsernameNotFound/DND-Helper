    "Name": "Aetherborn",
    "Description": "Aetherborn come into being spontaneously as part of the aether refinement process. Their bodies and minds are apparently formed out of some interaction between the volatile elements of aether that are removed during refinement and the psychic impressions created by the people involved in the process. But each aetherborn is a unique individual, not a mere copy of some other person\u2019s mind and shape. This race is little understood, and few aetherborn are willing to waste any of their short lives allowing vedalken scholars to study their biological and psychological characteristicsAetherborn are a strange living by-product of the process of aether refinement, cast in humanoid form but lacking any of the biological qualities of other races. They don\u2019t eat or sleep, and they don\u2019t reproduce\u2014nor do they have any physical sexual characteristics. Language that categorizes people into male or female categories thus breaks down when it comes to aetherborn. Most aetherborn prefer that others use the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d to refer to them, since it doesn\u2019t attribute a gender that they don\u2019t possess. Only a relative few prefer \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d having chosen to adopt a genderce: Plane Shift - Kaladesh",
