    "Name": "Shadar-kai- Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes",
    "Description": "Sworn to the Raven Queen's service, the mysterious shadar-kai venture into the Material Plane from the Shadowfell to advance her will. Once they were fey like the rest of their elven kin, and now they exist in a strange state between life and death. Eladrin and shadar-kai are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it.",
    "ASI": "Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\n",
    "Features": "Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.\n\nSize. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.\n\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\nDarkvision. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\nFey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.\n\nTrance. Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is trance. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.\n\nKeen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.\n\nNecrotic Resistance. You have resistance to necrotic damage.\n\nBlessing of the Raven Queen. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.\n\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven.\n"
