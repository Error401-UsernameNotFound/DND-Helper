    "Description": "Eladrin are elves of the Feywild, a realm of perilous beauty and boundless magic. Using that magic, eladrin can step from one place to another in the blink of an eye, and each eladrin resonates with emotions captured in the Feywild in the form of seasons \u2014 affinities that affect the eladrin\u2019s mood and appearance. An eladrin\u2019s season can change, though some remain in one season forever. Choose your season or roll on the Eladrin Seasons table. Your Trance trait lets you change your season.Like other elves, eladrin can live to be over 750 years old.\n\n\t\tEladrin Seasons\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nd4\t\tSeason\t\t\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1\t\tAutumn:\t\tAutumn: peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2\t\tWinter:\t\tWinter: contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3\t\tSpring:\t\tSpring: cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment and hope as winter's sorrow passes\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4\t\tSummer:\t\tSummer: boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy and calls to action\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n",
